# Emotion detection using deep learning

## Introduction

This project aims to classify the emotion on a person's face into one of **seven categories**, using deep convolutional neural networks. The model is trained on the **FER-2013** dataset which was published on International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML). This dataset consists of 35887 grayscale, 48x48 sized face images with **seven emotions** - angry, disgusted, fearful, happy, neutral, sad and surprised.

## Dependencies

* Python 3, [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/), [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* To install the required packages, run `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## How to use
* If you want to see the facebox around emotion
```bash
